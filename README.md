Potholes are one of the most damaging and costly road defects.The American Automobile Association estimated in the five years prior to 2016 that 16 million drivers in the United States have suffered damage from potholes to their vehicle including tire punctures, bent wheels, and damaged suspensions with a cost of $3 billion a year. In India, 3,000 people per year are killed in accidents involving potholes. Britain has estimated that the cost of fixing all roads with potholes in the country would cost Â£12 billion.

In this project, we are developing an automatic pothole detection method using Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) deep learning model. Our project was featured in a Google short video story (https://www.blog.google/technology/ai/how-machine-learning-can-drive-change-traffic-packed-l/) and KTLA's tech news report (https://ktla.com/2019/02/11/college-students-use-machine-learning-ai-to-combat-potholes/).
